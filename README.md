# eventAdd
API for creating calendar events

## Instructions
Simply open ```page.html``` in a browser to see an example. To add this to your own website, include all the fields with the same ID values as well as the script ```event-add.js```.

The ```Google``` and ```Yahoo``` URLs work with their own online calendars, and will automatically attempt to create an event when clicked. The iCalendar URL uses ```event-add.js``` to create a specially formatted iCalendar file that can be imported into most calendars.
